# FlightRank-2025

Welcome to the FlightRank-2025 repository!  
This project contains code and documentation for our participation in the Kaggle FlightRank 2025 competition.

## Overview

The Kaggle FlightRank 2025 competition challenges participants to develop machine learning models that accurately predict flight rankings based on a variety of features such as airline, route, weather, and historical performance.

This repository contains:
- Data exploration and preprocessing workflows
- Modeling experiments with different algorithms
- Ensemble methods to improve predictive performance
- Submission logic for Kaggle

## Repository Structure

- `notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebooks for exploratory analysis and model development
- `data/`: Sample datasets and data loaders (not included in repo due to size; see below)
- `src/`: Scripts and helper functions for preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation
- `README.md`: Project documentation (this file)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/phyzika10/FlightRank-2025.git
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**  
   The project primarily uses Python 3 and Jupyter Notebook.  
   It is recommended to use [conda](https://docs.conda.io/) or [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/) to install requirements:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Obtain the dataset**  
   Download competition data from the [Kaggle FlightRank 2025 competition page](https://www.kaggle.com/). Place the data files in the `data/` folder.

4. **Open the main notebook**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/main.ipynb
   ```
   Or use your preferred environment (VS Code, Kaggle, Google Colab).

## Usage

- Follow the workflow in `notebooks/main.ipynb` to explore the data, build models, and generate predictions.
- Adjust preprocessing, modeling, and ensemble logic as needed.
- Submit your predictions to the Kaggle competition.

## Methodology

The project leverages:
- Exploratory data analysis to uncover feature insights
- Feature engineering and selection for improved model performance
- Multiple modeling techniques (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks)
- Ensemble approaches for robustness and accuracy
